# Challenge 4 (Dynamic Programming)

## Knap Sack Problem
Given weights and values of n items, 
put these items in a knapsack of capacity C 
to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

### Dynamic Programming Steps taken
1. Identify the subproblems
2. What does the solution roughly look like
3. Define a base case
4. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
5. Compute the value of an optimal solution (recurse and memoize)
6. Solve original problem - reconstruct from the sub-problems
